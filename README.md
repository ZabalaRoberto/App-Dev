**Summary:**

The samurai didn’t stand a chance. First, the aliens invaded Japan. Next, they took all the jobs. And then they confiscated everyone’s swords. So what does a hotheaded former samurai like Sakata “Gin” Gintoki do to make ends meet? Take any odd job that comes his way, even if it means losing his dignity.
Rating: 9.9/10
Recommendation: The comedy episodes and arcs are a MUST-watch in anime format. You can binge-watch the first 300 episodes and after that, you can decide if you want to give the manga a try. At this point (Chapter 500’s and up), I think Gintama’s art had a boost that I can’t really say if watching the anime is any better. It has become a full-blown shounen so the panels and pages have become less wordy and dense. However, the voice actors of Gintama are phenomenal. This anime has my favorite voice casting ever. 

Both formats can equally serve you well. I honestly recommend going through both. Sorachi leaves some unforgettable notes in the manga and the animation team leaves their own quirks and fillers (the good kind!) in the anime.

IMPORTANT: DON’T SKIP ARCS!

_Comments
Here are the things that I really like the most, in bullet points:

- If you don’t mind dick and poop jokes, Gintama is for you. The running gags in this manga are beyond me. This is the kind of comedy that will make you say, “I want whatever Sorachi-sensei” is smoking. This series uses a lot of Japanese puns that don’t translate well in English so there will be a lot of learning when it comes to us non-native readers. They’re so worth it, though. Also, I still don’t know how Gintama isn’t banned yet – it’s very edgy and controversial!

- PARODIES. Nothing is safe from Gintama. One of my favorite aspects of the comedy in this series is its ability to parody ANYTHING under the sun. Gintama doesn’t care about copyright. And honestly, I’ll take a Gintama parody as a compliment. If you’re someone who has watched all the classics and big names in the anime industry, you’ll appreciate Gintama even more. My favorite parodies are still the Kuroko no Basket parody in the Jouishishi Arc, the Death Note parody in the Nabe Shogun oneshot, and the YuGiOh parody in the Otsuu arc. Plus the numerous One Piece, DragonBall and JoJo references!

- PLOT. What plot? Lol yeah, Gintama has a plot. It doesn’t come in full view until you are 500 chapters/300 episodes in. You can see snippets in some of the serious arcs sandwhiched in between the comedy arcs. I really can’t give you a perfect summary without spoiling you but imagine your favorite foods thrown in the same bowl, mixed together until it starts looking like pig’s food, but still tastes great. Yeah, that’s Gintama’s plot.

- ACTION. People who love Gintama know very well that the action can stand toe-to-toe against other popular shounen titles. Gintoki vs Takasugi? Gintoki vs Jirocho? The best.

- SLICE OF LIFE. If you’re someone who likes constant brawl, Gintama isn’t for you. The Slice of Life element of this series makes it so special. There are chapters where I forget that I’m even reading Gintama. Why are Gintama’s action scenes so good? The story-telling. If you skip the comedy arcs and watch the serious arcs by themselves, the main plot won’t matter. The action scenes are much more impactful because you understand what they’re fighting for, what they’re trying to protect. This is the reason why you shouldn’t skip the comedy arcs!

- DIALOGUE. Nothing beats Gintama when it comes to dialogue. Even Sorachi admits that it’s one of the aspects that he focuses on. This sounds cheesy but I can’t count the moments wherein Gintama’s dialogues have saved me or made me feel better. Dialogue is what sets it apart from the other shounen titles that I’ve read.

- There are a lot of series out there that can keep you hyped up, but this manga will make you love life. It’s not a zero to hero story. This is about Gintoki’s life after his prime. You guys know how much of a Sakura fan I am, but after reading Gintama, Gintoki just became my favorite fictional character of all time. To anyone who wants to give Gintama a chance, just make it to Chapter 520 or Episode 305. That point in the story will hurt you, and will make you understand why Gintoki is the way he is.
